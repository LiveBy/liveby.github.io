  "body": "## Neighborhood Profile Redirection\r\n\r\nThe LiveBy neighborhood finder provides automatic redirection to neighborhood profiles based on an address or lat/lon coordinate. This can be used to create links on property pages that direct homebuyers to neighborhood information for a property or listing.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a dynamic link to direct to the neighborhood profile for a lat/lon coordinate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"https://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&lat=40.773201&lon=-96.644859\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  View Neighborhood Profile\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Redirection URL\r\n\r\nThe base URL for the neighborhood redirector is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional query parameters are used to direct the user to the correct neighborhood profile based on the brokerage, address, or lat/lon.\r\n\r\n### Required Parameters\r\n\r\n#### brokerage\r\n\r\nThe `brokerage` parameter is required, and should be the the same as the last part of the neighborhood finder URL, like `woodsbros`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: If only the `brokerage` parameter is provide, the user will be directed to the brokerage's neighborhood finder page powered by LiveBy.\r\n\r\n### Optional Parameters\r\n\r\n#### lat/lon\r\n\r\nIf the latitude and longitude coordinates for a location are known, they can be specified as the query parameters `lat`, and `lon`.\r\n\r\n- `lat`: The latitude. Example, `lat=40.773201`\r\n- `lon`: The longitude. Example, `lon=-96.644859`\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&lat=40.773201&lon=-96.644859\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### address\r\n\r\nIf the latitude and longitude are not known, a complete address can be specified using the `address` parameter. The address parameter must be a url-encoded/escaped string which includes the address, street, city, state, and zip.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&address=1987%20Sewell%20St%2C%20Lincoln%2C%20NE%2068502\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note that the address query parameter should be encoded/escaped using [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) or something similar (like [`rawurlencode`](http://us3.php.net/manual/ro/function.rawurlencode.php) in PHP).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### city\r\n\r\nThe `city` parameter can be used to direct the homebuyer to the LiveBy Neighborhood Finder page for a certain city *if* there is no neighborhood for the location or address. This is an optional fallback, and is simply a city name like \"Lincoln\", or \"Omaha\".\r\n\r\nIf an address or location is *not* inside any neighborhood, the neighborhood redirector will direct the user to the Neighborhood Finder for the specified city.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&lat=40.67991&lon=-96.5100547&city=Lincoln\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### utm_source\r\n\r\nThe `utm_source` parameter identifies the referring source domain. It's usually a short string, like `woodsbros`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&lat=40.773201&lon=-96.644859&utm_source=woodsbros\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### utm_medium\r\n\r\nThe `utm_medium` parameter identifies the location of the link on the referring page, and is used to track the success of the placement of a link in different locations or mediums. \r\n\r\nSome possible values for `utm_medium` might be `property_listing`, `banner`, or `sidebar`. While this parameter is optional, it allows LiveBy to provide analytics about the success or popularity of neighborhood profile links in varying locations.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://liveby.co/neighborhood?brokerage=woodsbros&lat=40.773201&lon=-96.644859&utm_source=woodsbros&location=property_listing\r\n```",
