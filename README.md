The LiveBy integration API provides methods for accessing neighborhood information, as well as preferences for users who have created an account through the neighborhood discovery tool for brokerages. The API can be used to build custom integration into a content management or customer relationship management system.


## [Vendor API](/vendor)

The <a href="./vendor">Vendor API</a> provides methods for securely retrieving neighborhood preference information for users. It requires an access token, which can be retrieved by contacting <a href="mailto:integration@liveby.co">integration@liveby.co</a>.

## [Neighborhood Profile Redirection](/profile-redirection)

The LiveBy neighborhood finder provides automatic redirection to neighborhood profiles based on an address or lat/lon coordinate. This can be used to create links on property pages that direct homebuyers to neighborhood information for a property or listing.
